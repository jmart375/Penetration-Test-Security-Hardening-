# Penetration-Test-Security-Hardening-

Our team's primary objective was to compile a comprehensive report detailing the System Security Requirements for the project at hand. Leveraging the expertise of FMJ2 Net Shield in the domains of security engineering, network specialization, and systems administration, we conducted an exhaustive examination of Design World's cloud infrastructure. Our aim was to identify any potential vulnerabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of existing safeguards. As a result of our rigorous analysis, we obtained a nuanced understanding of the security landscape and surfaced potential weaknesses. This knowledge will enable us to reinforce the system's defenses and proceed with a Vulnerability Assessment Plan to pinpoint any latent vulnerabilities and enhance the system's security.
